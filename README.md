# WIP: EPIC (Every-Position-In-Charge)

Consider you have parked in hurry your car or bicycle  at a place which can be found hardly.
Or you found a place you want to come back, but you can't find a street name. 
Or you have a picknic with your friends and one of them couldn't find the place where you are.

Wouldn't it easy to mark the position where you parked or share your location with your friends ?
EPIC is the solution for that kind of issues.
